Overview

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

Modern app platform

The Docker platform is the only container platform to build, secure and manage the widest array of applications from development to production both on premises and in the cloud. Docker Community Edition [CE] empowers developers with tools to build applications and Docker Enterprise Edition [EE] provides IT with multi-architecture operations at scale. Docker delivers both an engine for innovation that modernizes without disruption while reducing total costs by more than 50%. Unlike other solutions that specialize in a narrow slice of the enterprise IT portfolio, Docker delivers operations at scale by addressing a diverse set of applications and infrastructure for both developers and IT.

the docker journey

The container journey starts with the existing applications that run your business. By making them faster, more secure and cheaper to operate, Docker helps free up time and resources to build new applications for your customers. Transform IT without having to re-tool, re-code or re-educate existing applications, policies or staff. Once containerized and on the secure supply chain, Docker uniquely addresses the needs across your IT organization -- from bringing the legacy forward to enabling future development. Accelerate your time to market, time to value and increase return on investment (ROI).

    Modernize Traditional Apps [MTA]
    Modernize Traditional Apps [MTA]

    The first step with Docker is to modernize the existing application portfolio. Packaging existing apps into containers immediately improves security, reduce costs, and gain cloud portability. This transformation applies modern properties to legacy applications - all without changing a single line of code.

    Hybrid Cloud
    Hybrid Cloud

    Cloud migration, multi-cloud or hybrid cloud infrastructure require frictionless portability of applications. Docker packages applications and their dependencies together into an isolated container making them portable to any infrastructure. Eliminate the “works on my machine” problem once and for all. Docker certified infrastructure ensures the containerized applications work consistently.

    Continuous Integration and Deployment [DevOps]
    Continuous Integration and Deployment [DevOps]

    Integrate modern methodologies and automate development pipelines with the integration of Docker and DevOps. The isolated nature of containers make it conducive to rapidly changing environments by eliminating app conflicts and increasing developer productivity. Docker enables a true separation of concerns to accelerate the adoption of DevOps processes.

    Microservices
    Microservices

    Docker containers are lightweight by design and ideal for enabling microservices application development. Accelerate development, deployment and rollback of tens or hundreds of containers composed as a single application. Whether building new microservices or transitioning monoliths to smaller services, simple to use tools make it easy to compose, deploy and maintain complex applications.
