Abstract:
This article observes the possibility of protection network resources from malicious attacks using traps that simulate SSH service. There are overviewed main types of attacks, analyzed existing software solutions, its basic working principles and opportunities for further improvement. In addition, there is described author's solution, which can increase the attractiveness of SSH honeypot working under Ubuntu OS.
