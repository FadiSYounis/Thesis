goenv

Travis GoDoc
What?

Goenv is a Go package that provides virtualenv-like functionality for Go projects, isolating dependencies into workspaces for safer and simpler management.
Why?

Go's package management expects that all go source files and packages will exist under a single system directory, GOPATH. This makes it easy to install and find packages, but means that any projects being worked on will share the same GOPATH, which can cause issues if different versions of packages are required and make it difficult to create isolated, reproducible builds.
Features

    Similar functionality to Python's virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.
    Separates development directory from import path - e.g., develop in ~/myproject , but import from github.com/me/myproject
    Isolates dependencies from other projects.
    Does not interfere with any go command functionality.
    Written in Go, installable with go get .

Quick start

First, ensure your PATH includes the /bin directory in your global GOPATH , with something like:

 PATH=PATH:$GOPATH/bin  

Install this package:

 go get github.com/crsmithdev/goenv  

Within your project directory, create a goenv:

 goenv github.com/me/myproject  

Activate the goenv:

 . goenv/activate  

Install packages with go get or other dependency managment tools.

 go get github.com/hoisie/redis  

When finished, deactivate the goenv:

 deactivate  

Commands
Init

 Usage: goenv init [-g][-s][-p][-n] [import path] Init initializes a goenv and creates an initialization script that activates it. This script creates, if needed, a GOPATH directory structure, symlinks the project into that structure at the specified input path, and then alters the current session's GOPATH environment variable to point to it. The goenv can be deactivated with 'deactivate'. Init supports the following options: -n the name of the environment, defaulting to the name of the current working directory. -g the GOPATH to create, defaulting to ~/.goenv/<name> -p the project path, defaulting to the current working directory. -s the full path to the initialization script, defaulting to ./goenv/activate.  

Help

 Usage: goenv help [command] Help gets detailed usage information for a command.
