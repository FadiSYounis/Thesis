Short Summary: 

The market demand for online machine-learning services is increasing, and so to
have are the threats to them. Adversarial inputs represent a new threat to Machine-
Learning-as-a-Services (MLaaSs). Meticulously crafted malicious inputs can be used to
mislead and confuse the learning model, even in cases where the adversary only has
access to input and output labels. As a result, there has been increased interest in
defence techniques to combat these types of attacks.
In this thesis, we propose a network of high-interaction honeypots as a decentral-
ized defence framework that prevents an adversary from corrupting the learning model,
primarily through the use of deception. We accomplish our aim by 1) preventing the
attacker from correctly learning the labels and approximating the architecture of the
black-box system; 2) luring the attacker away, towards a decoy model, using HoneyTo-
kens; and 3) creating infeasible computational work for the adversary.
