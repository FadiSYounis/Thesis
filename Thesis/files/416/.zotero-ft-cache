crypt

You can use crypt as a command line tool or as a configuration library:

    crypt cli
    crypt/config

Demo

Watch Kelsey explain crypt in this quick 5 minute video:

Crypt Demonstration Video
Generating gpg keys and keyrings

The crypt cli and config package require gpg keyrings.
Create a key and keyring from a batch file

 vim app.batch  

 %echo Generating a configuration OpenPGP key Key-Type: default Subkey-Type: default Name-Real: app Name-Comment: app configuration key Name-Email: app@example.com Expire-Date: 0 %pubring .pubring.gpg %secring .secring.gpg %commit %echo done  

Run the following command:

 gpg2 --batch --armor --gen-key app.batch  

You should now have two keyrings, .pubring.gpg which contains the public keys, and .secring.gpg which contains the private keys.

    Note the private key is not protected by a passphrase.
